Movie-Streaming-Torrent
=======================

* * *

A simpler way to play movies with torrent without having to download it completely to watch it. Just search, choose the movie and the code will open in a player compatible with your system.

Currently it is only compatible with windows system. In possible future updates, it will be able to play on any operating system.

Based on "WEB SCRAPING", and "PEERFLIX", the code searches on pirated movie sites, from where it returns the torrent magnetic link and creates a mini server with peerflix, giving access so that your network can access the file/movie that is being accessed on the route that was opened on your internet.
